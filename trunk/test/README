locktest - for lock performance comparison with/without deterministic execution 

deadlock - thread1 and thread2 try to acquire locks in reverse order. 
	   In standard pthread environment, this mean deadlock is possible depending on timing.
	   However, in dpthread the behavior is determined by the input; in other words, if it worked without 
	   a deadlock for a input, it will be the same all the time for that input.
